  abstract = {Wild capture fisheries produce 90 million tonnes of food each year and have the potential to provide sustainable livelihoods for nearly 40 million people around the world (http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5555e.pdf). After decades of overfishing since industrialization, many global fish stocks have recovered, a change brought about through effective management. We provide a synthetic overview of three approaches that managers use to sustain stocks: regulating catch and fishing mortality, regulating effort and regulating spatial access. Within each of these approaches, we describe common restrictions, how they alter incentives to change fishing behaviour, and the resultant ecological, economic and community-level outcomes. For each approach, we present prominent case-studies that illustrate behaviour and the corresponding performance. These case-studies show that sustaining target stocks requires a hard limit on fishing mortality under most conditions, but that additional measures are required to generate economic benefits. Different systems for allocation allow stakeholder communities to strike a locally acceptable balance between profitability and employment.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates environmental drivers of U.S. West Coast petrale sole (Eopsetta jordani) recruitment as an initial step toward developing an environmental recruitment index that can inform the stock assessment in the absence of survey observations of age-0 and age-1 fish. First, a conceptual life history approach is used to generate life-stage-specific and spatio-temporally specific mechanistic hypotheses regarding oceanographic variables that likely influence survival at each life stage. Seven life history stages are considered, from female spawner condition through benthic recruitment as observed in the Northwest Fisheries Science Center West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (age-2 fish). The study area encompasses the region from 40 to 48\textdegree N in the California Current Ecosystem. Hypotheses are tested using output from a regional ocean reanalysis model outputs and model selection techniques. Four oceanographic variables explained 73\% of the variation in recruitment not accounted for by estimates based exclusively on the spawning stock size. Recruitment deviations were (a) positively correlated with degree days during the female precondition period, (b) positively correlated with mixed-layer depth during the egg stage, (c) negatively correlated with cross-shelf transport during the larval stage, and (d) negatively correlated with cross-shelf transport during the benthic juvenile stage. While multiple mechanisms likely affect petrale sole recruitment at different points during their life history, the strength of the relationship is promising for stock assessment and integrated ecosystem assessment applications.},

  abstract = {Fish populations with spatial structure inherently violate the assumption of a single well-mixed stock, necessitating the use of spatially-structured population dynamics models. Accounting for spatial structure accurately and easily is a major goal for the next generation of stock assessment software development. Reference points (e.g., limit or target harvest rates and their associated biomass) are inherent to stock assessments and are often calculated under equilibrium conditions. However, the calculation process can be challenging for spatially-structured population dynamics models. We outline how to calculate equilibrium quantities within spatially-structured models where density-dependence in recruitment is local. We compare those values to equivalent situations when density-dependence in recruitment is global, thereby extending the set of population dynamics models on which spatially-structured stock assessments could be based. Results suggest that our method for calculating reference points under the assumption of local density-dependence can be performed using a straightforward optimization routine, and provide clearer understanding of the effects of fishing on a spatially-structured population. Finally, we address areas of research and development needed to integrate spatially-structured population dynamics models within existing management systems.},

  abstract = {Indices of annual growth variation are not routinely incorporated into fisheries stock assessment models, due to a lack of a general framework for deciding when to include these indices, and of a mechanistic understanding about growth drivers. Such incorporation may also not necessarily lead to improved estimation or management performance. We demonstrate a way to incorporate such an index into an assessment model (Stock Synthesis), and use risk analysis to evaluate its management-related advantages and shortcomings. We applied this method to splitnose rockfish (Sebastes diploproa), where a previously developed growth index is highly correlated with decadal-scale climate indices. We find that including a similar index in the simulated assessment increases precision and reduces bias of parameter estimates. However, not including an index or including a completely erroneous index led to highly imprecise estimates when growth was strongly climate-driven. Including this growth index when individual growth was actually constant did not lead to poorer estimation performance. The risk analysis approach can be applied to other stocks to evaluate the consequences of including an index of growth variation.},

Most fisheries stock assessments assume constant values for each life history parameter, despite growing evidence that growth is variable at individual, temporal, and spatial scales. Otoliths contain important information pertaining to age and growth, among other things, and otolith increment data correlate with climate indices on a decadal scale. We expand on this concept to include individual- and year-level variation, and develop a nonlinear mixed-effects model to analyze otolith increment data. We then fit the model to otolith increment data for splitnose rockfish, and simulation-test the ability to precisely estimate year effects without bias. Generally, given a sample size of at least 50 otoliths, the model performs well at estimating year effects. With this method, species-specific indices of growth can be extracted from otolith increment data, and potentially be used in stock assessments to detect the effects of climate change on fish growth.},

Consumer power to choose sustainably-harvested species is threatened by seafood mislabeling, which may be a product of fraud or human error. Here we examined the prevalence of mislabeling, and its financial and ecological implications, by compiling and analyzing an international dataset of DNA barcoding studies of marine finfish (n = 43). On average, DNA-identified species sold were less expensive (-2.98\% ex-vessel price) and more sustainable (+3.88\% IUCN status) than species listed on their label; thus, mislabeling had a net positive impact on the conservation status of sold species. However, ecological impacts of some frequently mislabeled taxa were potentially severe, suggesting eco-conscious consumers may want to avoid certain genera. Mislabeling may be reduced by increasing traceability and identification of seafoods, particularly at points in the chain-of-custody beyond ports, where the majority of mislabeling occurred.},

  abstract = {Oceanographic processes and ecological interactions can strongly influence recruitment success in marine fishes. Here, we develop an environmental index of sablefish recruitment with the goal of elucidating recruitment-environment relationships and informing stock assessment. We start with a conceptual life-history model for sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria on the US west coast to generate stage- and spatio-temporally-specific hypotheses regarding the oceanographic and biological variables likely influencing sablefish recruitment. Our model includes seven stages from pre-spawn female condition through benthic recruitment (age-0 fish) for the northern portion of the west coast U.S. sablefish stock (40\textdegree N\textendash 50\textdegree N). We then fit linear models and use model comparison to select predictors. We use residuals from the stock-recruitment relationship in the 2015 sablefish assessment as the dependent variable (thus removing the effect of spawning stock biomass). Predictor variables were drawn primarily from ROMS model outputs for the California Current Ecosystem. We also include indices of prey and predator abundance and freshwater input. Five variables explained 57\% of the variation in recruitment not accounted for by the stock-recruitment relationship in the sablefish assessment. Recruitment deviations were positively correlated with (i) colder conditions during the spawner preconditioning period, (ii) warmer water temperatures during the egg stage, (iii) stronger cross-shelf transport to near-shore nursery habitats during the egg stage, (iv) stronger long-shore transport to the north during the yolk-sac stage, and (v) cold surface water temperatures during the larval stage. This result suggests that multiple mechanisms likely affect sablefish recruitment at different points in their life history.},
